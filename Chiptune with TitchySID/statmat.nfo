 TitchySID is a library written in MASM32
 that plays SID chiptunes from the Commodore
 64. It currently only supports PSID format
 files, but it is hoped that other formats
 will be added in the future. It aims to be
 the smallest SID player library available
 and to be added easily to any development
 project on Microsoft platforms.
